# kjaymiller's .dotfiles

This repo is a collection of dotfiles and scripts that I use to configure my system.

The dotfiles are configured using [stow](https://tamerlan.dev/how-i-manage-my-dotfiles-using-gnu-stow/).

## Installation

I'm using a mac. I think most of these tools are also supported on linux, but no guarantees.

- Install Stow

  `brew install stow`

- Fork the repo
- cd into the repo
- run `stow .`
