# zshrc_plugins

This is a list of ZSH scripts that are used by my .zshrc_plugins

## Why not include them in the .zshrc

If you need to know...It's because I forget what they are doing and I am often like "where do I go to do thing..."

A specific file is also easier to have someone copy than "Oh you should copy lines 345-364" (Also those lines can change).

# How do you run them?

I have those absolutely dangerous command that calls source on all the `.sh` files in the directory.

Should you do this... Moving on.
